        <h2>🦠 What Was Polio?</h2>
        <p>Polio was a devastating viral disease that primarily affected children. It caused paralysis, muscle weakness, and sometimes death. During the early 20th century, polio outbreaks caused panic and forced the closure of public spaces like swimming pools and schools.</p>
        <p>Before the vaccine, polio paralyzed or killed over half a million people worldwide every year. Salk's vaccine reduced the number of cases by more than 90% in a few years.</p>

        <h2>🔬 Scientific Achievements</h2>
        <p>Jonas Salk used a killed-virus approach to develop his polio vaccine. It was an innovative method that did not rely on a live virus, making it safer than other strategies. Unlike many scientists of his time, Salk prioritized safety, testing his vaccine on himself, his family, and thousands of volunteers.</p>
        <p>He refused to patent the vaccine, declaring: <em>"Could you patent the sun?"</em>. He believed science should serve humanity, not profit.</p>
